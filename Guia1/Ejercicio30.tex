Para facilidad del ejercicio, sustituiremos los valores de la ecuacion desde un inicio, de manera que quedaria:

$1.7=-\frac{32.17}{2\omega^2}(\frac{e^{\omega}-e^{-\omega}}{2}-sin(\omega))$
\noindent \\El metodo de Steffensen nos pide encontrar g(x)=x, por lo tanto despejamos en nuestra ecuacion:

$g(\omega)=3.4\omega^2+32.17(\frac{e^{\omega}-e^{-\omega}}{2}-sin(\omega))$
\\En matlab tenemos: $gx=3.4*x^2+32.17*(((exp(x)-exp(-x))/(2))-sin(x));$

\\Podemos intuir que tenemos una raiz en el intervalo de [-0.5,2]. Vamos a ejecutar el programa con un valor iniciarl de -0.6

\\Por lo tanto, $\omega=-0.502579371875723$
