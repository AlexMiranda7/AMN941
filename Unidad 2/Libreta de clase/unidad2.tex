\begin{figure}[ht]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{img/lag1.png}

    A cada uno de los puntos vamos a llamarlo $t_0, t_1, t_2 y t_3$ y a su imagen les llamaremos 
    $f(t_0), f(t_1), f(t_2) y f(t_3)$

\noindent \\a) Iniciemos contruyendo el polinomio de Lagrange. El grado del polinomio sera uno menos que la cantidad de terminos que tenemos.

$p^{(3)}(x)=f(t_0)*L_0(t)+f(t_1)*L1(t)+f(t_2)*L2(t)+f(t_3)*L3(t)$
